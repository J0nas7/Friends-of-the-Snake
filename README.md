# Friends-of-the-Snake

The association "Friends of the snake" needs an index of members.

For each member membership number, name and a list of the snakes that the member has should be registered.

For each snake a number, name and type and should be registered.

Make classes for index, member and snake.

Make methods making it possible to add new members and their snakes and to list a selected member or all members and their snakes.

Some snakes are very toxic and some are protected.

If a snake of type ”mamba” is added print a warning telling that the snake is very toxic.

If a snake of type ”anaconda” is met print a message telling that the snake is protected and cannot be added.
